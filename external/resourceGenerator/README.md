# ResourceGenerator

A simple command line tool that generates a C++ source file from arbitrary resources.

## Usage

Call the tool using the following command line:
```
resourceGenerator outputFile -type<resource> [-type<resource>...]
```
Where availables types are:
```
-b<resource>   A binary file.
-t<resource>   A text file.
```

## Example

Let's use the following `level.tmx` file as input of the tool:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<map width="48" height="36" tilewidth="16" tileheight="16">
  <tileset firstgid="1" name="Tileset" tilewidth="16" tileheight="16" tilecount="9" columns="3">
    <image source="tileset.png" width="48" height="48"/>
  </tileset>
</map>
```

The command line will be:
```
resourceGenerator resources.cpp -tlevel.tmx
```

Once the command executed, the file `resources.cpp` will contain the following:
```cpp
#include <stdlib.h>

extern "C" const unsigned char level_tmx[] =

## Important notes

- Variable names are generated using the resource's name and extension. Any non alphanumeric character will be replaced by a `_` (`isalnum` is used internally to do this check).

- A binary resource generates 2 variables, one for the data and one for its actual size. So, for a binary resource called `mydb.bin`, `mydb_bin` and `mydb_bin_size` variables will be generated.

- Unlike binary resources, a text resource generates only 1 variable (for the data). The character `'\0'` is appended to this variable, so that it can be used like any other C char array.
